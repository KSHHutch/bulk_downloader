# bulk_downloader

The bulk_downloader app is an extremely simple Streamlit app to automate downloading images or pdfs from a list of URLs. It was written for a very specific use case, so will likely not find much general usage.

It expects a CSV file input. You select which column contains the URLs, and which columns you want the downloaded file names.

This is a script that was designed with Linux/macOS in mind as it automatically creates a directory in /Users/<username>/Downloads to download files to.
