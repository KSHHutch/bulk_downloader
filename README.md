# bulk_downloader

The bulk_downloader app is an extremely simple Streamlit app to automate downloading images or pdfs from a list of URLs. It's pretty basic in its scope and implemenatation.

It expects a CSV file input. You select which column contains the URLs, and which columns you want the downloaded file names.

It downloads files to the app, then zips it up. After that process is finished a button will appear with the option to download as .zip to your computer locally.
